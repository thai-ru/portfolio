# 2024 Guide to Accessibility in Mobile Apps

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which all accessibility standards are based on, apply to both web pages and mobile applications, including native and hybrid apps. These guidelines provide detailed instructions on how website and app owners can make their platforms accessible to users with varying disabilities, ensuring they are not discriminated against in day-to-day life.

An accessible mobile app ensures that all users have an equivalent experience while using the app. The primary goal of accessibility and inclusive design is to make your app work equivalently for different ranges of users. Whether you're designing a web app, a native app, or a hybrid app, accessibility can help you to create a highly performative product.

## The Importance of Accessible Mobile Apps

Smartphones are ubiquitous, but limiting app accessibility to only those who are physically or mentally able is not desirable. By neglecting accessibility, app developers unintentionally create barriers for important groups of disabled users.

### Legal Requirements and Guidelines for Mobile Accessibility

Legal requirements for mobile app accessibility vary by country. In the United States, for example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) governs mobile app accessibility. This law mandates that mobile apps, like other digital platforms, be accessible to individuals with disabilities. The ADA prohibits discrimination based on disability in places of public accommodation, which includes websites and mobile apps.

Additionally, there's the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA), which offers telecommunication protection to those with disabilities. The WCAG also sets standards for accessibility across most modern apps and websites.

## Why Your App(s) Need to Be Accessible

Neglecting accessibility excludes more than 1 billion users with disabilities, resulting in missed business opportunities. Prioritizing accessibility not only improves user experience but also expands your customer base. Accessible apps foster inclusivity, build user loyalty, and enhance long-term business success. Moreover, making your app accessible helps avoid costly lawsuits, especially given the increasing number of ADA-related cases worldwide.

### Mobile Application Accessibility Checklist

- **Pay Attention to Color Contrast:** Good color contrast is crucial, especially for users with visual impairments or those using the app outdoors. Text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for regular text and 3:1 for larger text.
- **Simplify App Gestures:** Keep gestures simple to make the app easier for users with disabilities. Prefer tap or swipe gestures over more complex ones.
- **Adjust Tap Target Sizes:** Ensure that interactive elements like buttons are large enough and spaced out to prevent accidental taps.
- **Make Data Entry Easy:** Simplify data entry by using checkboxes and autofill options for fields like date and time. Providing data-sharing functionality can also streamline the process.
- **Keep Layouts Consistent:** Ensure that information and navigation elements remain consistent across different screens. Even if using a hamburger menu, maintain the same order of menu items.

## Testing Your App(s) for Accessibility

The 4 main testing methods that are used to test for mobile app accessibility include:

1. Test on real mobile devices of different sizes.
2. Use tests that incorporate assistive technologies.
3. Test on responsive windows on a desktop device.
4. Test on a desktop device.

### Testing Tools on Different Devices

#### Android Accessibility Testing Tools

- **Google Accessibility Scanner:** Automatically scans Android apps for common accessibility issues, such as missing labels, small touch targets, and color contrast problems.
- **TalkBack Accessibility:** This built-in feature allows users to use Screen Readers on Android devices. Although effective, it requires manual testing to ensure thorough coverage.

#### iOS Accessibility Testing Tools

- **Xcode Accessibility Inspector:** A built-in tool in Xcode for inspecting and testing accessibility attributes in iOS apps.
- **VoiceOver:** A native screen reader for iOS devices, used to test how apps interact with screen reader users.

## Conclusion

Mobile app accessibility doesn't have to be complex. By following a checklist, identifying potential issues, and using the appropriate testing methodologies, you can create accessible apps that support business growth. Apps that are accessible and inclusive are more likely to be adopted by users, regardless of their abilities, thereby expanding your user base and enhancing your brand's reputation.
